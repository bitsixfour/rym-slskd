Random stuff to make Rate Your Music (RYM) cooler

# Downloader
You need to use the slskd API in order for this to work. This requires a server. There are niche use cases where SLSK does not have an album. If you can't find an album, you would likely have to go on RED and download it manually.

# Future plans  
* Theme RYM using album cover data for that specific album page
* Scrape the top 5,000 albums on AOTY and present specific album ratings from AOTY in RYM pages
* Prioritize .log .cue files when downloading
