# rym-slskd
Uses a slskd instance and intergrates it with RYM so you can download releases easier.

# Notes
You need to use the slskd API in order for this to work. This requires a server. There are niche use cases where SLSK does not have an album. If you can't find an album, you would likely have to go on RED and download it manually anyways. I don't want to deal with w/ Lidarr (It's unreliable in my experience) so slskd was the only real option w/ API documentation. This is only for firefox (as of now) because I don't use a chromium-based browser. 

# Future plans  
* Prioritize .log .cue files when downloading
* .html popup to customize api-key/url dynamically

This is mostly just a proof-of-concept, but I expect you to atleast know what you're doing (I don't) as this requires using slskd. WIP.
