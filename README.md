# rym-slskd
Uses a slskd instance and intergrates it with RYM so you can download releases easier.

# Notes
You need to use the slskd API in order for this to work. This requires a server. There are niche use cases where SLSK does not have an album. Just go on RED or something. This is only for firefox (as of now) because I don't use a chromium-based browser. Sadly, https is required for this on your slskd instance :(   

# Future plans  
* Prioritize .log .cue files when downloading
* .html popup to customize api-key/url dynamically
* Not force the user to nginx their slskd instance

This is mostly just a proof-of-concept, but I expect you to atleast know what you're doing (I don't) as this requires using slskd. WIP.
